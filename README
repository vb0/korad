THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

WORK IN PROGRESS

This will control a KA3005P lab power supply

The device is hard coded (this is my default usb->serial device on raspi): /dev/ttyACM0

I've used quite a few modules (maybe too many), including the pyserial module

Usage:

run kcontrol.py
It will output every 1.x seconds or so (there are some "hard" coded timers that can be easily changed) something like:

44mA 5.00V 0.22000W 0.25496mWh 0.050993mAh 4.3s SET:700mA 5.00V

As the power supply is locked for some time after any serial command, I have added the following rudimentary controls:

v V lower v is voltage "-0.01", V, as in shift+v is +"0.01"
i I current down and up
o O output off/on
q quit
